        "# Problem Statement:\n",
        "\n",
        "The e-commerce business has become incredibly popular in recent years. Unlike traditional retail, businesses no longer need to interact with customers in person to take orders. Instead, companies launch websites to sell their products directly to consumers. Customers can conveniently browse and purchase items from these websites. Well-known examples of such e-commerce companies include Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Paytm, and Snapdeal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you are working as a Machine Learning Engineer at an e-commerce company named Ebuss. Ebuss has established a significant market share across various domains, offering a wide range of products, including household essentials, books, personal care products, medicines, cosmetics, beauty items, electrical appliances, kitchen and dining products, and healthcare items.\n",
        "\n",
        "To stay competitive in the rapidly evolving e-commerce landscape, Ebuss needs to leverage technology to accelerate its growth and challenge established market leaders like Amazon and Flipkart.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a Senior Machine Learning Engineer, you have been tasked with enhancing the product recommendation system to deliver improved suggestions to users based on their past reviews and ratings.\n",
        "\n",
        "To achieve this, you propose building a sentiment-based product recommendation system. The project will involve the following key tasks:\n",
        "-\tData Sourcing and Sentiment Analysis\n",
        "Collect and analyze user reviews to understand their sentiments towards various products.\n",
        "-\tBuilding a Recommendation System\n",
        "Develop a system that suggests products based on user preferences and behaviors.\n",
        "-\tEnhancing Recommendations with Sentiment Analysis\n",
        "Integrate sentiment insights into the recommendation engine to make suggestions more personalized and effective.\n",
        "-\tDeploying an End-to-End Solution with a User Interface\n",
        "Create an intuitive user interface to allow customers to interact seamlessly with the recommendation system.\n",
        "\n",
        "This comprehensive approach will help Ebuss deliver a superior user experience, ultimately fostering customer loyalty and driving business growth."

        "\t1.\tAccuracy: Logistic Regression achieved a high accuracy score, meaning it correctly classified the majority of the test data. This is crucial in ensuring that the model can reliably predict user sentiment (positive or negative) based on the provided features.\n",
        "\t2.\tAUC Score: The AUC score, which measures the model’s ability to distinguish between the two classes (positive and negative sentiment), was also high. A higher AUC indicates that the model is better at ranking predictions, providing strong confidence that it can classify unseen data correctly. This is especially important in cases where class imbalance exists, as it reflects the model’s performance across all classification thresholds.\n",

        "\t1.\tLower RMSE for User-Based Recommendation: RMSE is a common metric used to measure the difference between predicted and actual ratings. A lower RMSE indicates that the model’s predictions are closer to the true ratings, meaning the recommendation system is performing better. In my case, the user-based recommendation model showed a much lower RMSE, suggesting that it was more accurate in predicting users’ preferences compared to the item-based model.\n",
        "\t2.\tUser Similarity Focus: The user-based collaborative filtering approach leverages the idea that users with similar preferences will have similar ratings for items. Since the dataset had users with well-defined patterns of preferences, the user-based model was able to better capture these similarities and provide more accurate predictions.\n",
        "\t3.\tItem-Based Recommendation Challenges: The item-based recommendation model, which focuses on similarities between items,struggles when the number of items is large or when items have fewer interactions. This could result in less accurate predictions and a higher RMSE, as seen in our case.\n",
